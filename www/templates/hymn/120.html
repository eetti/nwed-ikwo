	<p class="verse-number">1</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n; and death's dark judgment flood</p>
	<p>Is passed, in Him who bought us with His blood.</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: we stand beyond the doom</p>
	<p>Of all our sin, through Jesus' empty tomb.</p>

<div class="verse hymn-block">
	<p class="verse-number">2</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: with Him we also rose,</p>
	<p>And in His grave see vanquished all our foes.</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: beyond the judgment land,</p>
	<p>In Him, in resurrection-life we stand.</p>

<div class="verse hymn-block">
	<p class="verse-number">3</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: and now redeemed to God,</p>
	<p>We tread the desert which His feet have trod.</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: the sanctu'ry's our place,</p>
	<p>Where now we dwell before the Father's face.</p>

<div class="verse hymn-block">
	<p class="verse-number">4</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: the Lord is gone before.</p>
	<p>We long to see Him, and to sin no more.</p>
	<p>The Lord is ris'n: our triumph-shout shall be,</p>
	<p>"Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!"</p>
